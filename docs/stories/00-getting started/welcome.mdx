# Welcome

The Findest Design System is a collection of standards, foundations, components & hooks to help anyone make Strapi's
contributions more cohesive and to build plugins more efficiently.

## Our approach

### Consistency

The design-system we provide empowers individuals to build consistent experiences across the Strapi application. This
cohorent journey creates a more enjoyable experience for our users.

### Composability

Our APIs are designed to be flexible and composable, allowing you to build the experience you want. This is delivered
within the confines of Findest's design styles. When adding new ones, think about how we can promote this flexibility
without complex prop drilling.
